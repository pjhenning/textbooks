    // General observations:- I find the mix of historical storylines and interactives captivating.- Consider adding a few more 'check for understanding' kinds of questions to break up text and transition from one section/sub-section to another.- Spatial reasoning can take a lot of work for some students to pick up. consider adding tutor prompts that are unique to the topic your discussing.- Think about standardizing how you want to write 2D and 3D +philipp@mathigon.org would be a big help here.- The transitions and storyline references dwindle toward the end of the chapter. I'm excited to see this one in action!

    // Glossary entry - Dimension: Dimensions in mathematics are the measure of the size or distance of an object.

So far, we’ve only looked at the geometry of flat, 2-dimensional objects like circles or rectangles – but we live in a three-dimensional world. Every object we see or touch has three __dimensions__.

::: column.grow

A point has zero dimensions. A point just specifies a location but it has no size.

A line has one dimension, we can measure its length (l), but it has no width or thickness.

A square has two dimensions, we can measure its length (l) and, perpendicular to that, its width (w).

A cube has three dimensions, we can measure its length (l); width (w); and perpendicular to both of those dimensions, we have its height (h).

Plane Geometry deals with points, lines, and two-dimensional (2D) shapes like polygons and circles which do not have any thickness. __Polygons__ are plane figures that have only length and width.

Solid Geometry is the study of three-dimensional (3D) shapes that have depth or thickness as well as length and width. Even a paper has a thickness and is a 3D shape, but since its thickness is so small, we often neglect it.

As soon as humankind began constructing complex buildings, we needed solid geometry. In some Babylonian and Egyptian texts, you can see that they are concerned about the problems related to the sizes of the pyramids and other structures they have made.

Since then, architects have been using 3D geometry to define the spatial form of a building.  Nowadays, the design of buildings is continually advancing by combining different 3D shapes and their properties.

> id: examples

Just like we’ve classified flat geometric shapes into a few categories like polygons or quadrilaterals, we can classify 3D Solids into a few different types:

__A polyhedron is a three-dimensional geometric solid with flat sides. The plural of polyhedron is “polyhedra”.__
The word polyhedron comes from the Classical Greek as poly (many) + hedron (base, face)

Polyhedra have many different shapes and sizes like polygons.
They can be as simple as a cube or a pyramid, or as complex as a star polyhedron with lots of sides.

FACE: The polygons that make up its surface of the polyhedron.
EDGE: The line segments where two of its faces are connected.
VERTEX: The “corners” of a polyhedron are called its vertices.

Even though we live in a 3D world, grasping 3D shapes and their properties may be a challenge.

The Flatland is an animated film based on Edwin Abbott’s book Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions. The movie revolves around the inability of 2D shapes to grasp the third dimension. Characters are circles, triangles, and squares living in a 2D world. Their reality is shattered when a sphere from the 3D World comes to visit.

Without realising, you will have seen many different types of polyhedra before:

### Cubes

One of the most common types of 3D solids is a cube.

A cube is a 3d shape that has 6 faces all of which are [[squares]].

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch1_3.png" width="200" height="207")

::: column.grow

For instance, The Rubik's Cube is a classic toy invented in 1974 by Hungarian architecture and design professor Erno Rubik.  Each of the faces of a Rubik’s cube contains 9 colored squares.

Although one of the smaller cubes (the central one) is not exposed, if we count carefully, we see that the Rubik’s cube is made up of [[27]] smaller rotatable cubes arranged in a 3x3x3 grid.

:::

A cube has all its sides of the same length. If the length of all its sides is 1 unit, then it is called a unit cube. Unit cubes can be stacked together to create different 3D solids.

The 3D solids below consist of unit cubes. Can we find out the number of cubes used in each one including the hidden cubes?

Rotate the solids below to find the number of cubes that used to build them.

### Cuboids

::: column.grow

As with a square being rectangle, a cube is a cuboid.

A __cuboid__ is a box-shaped, where all six sides are rectangles. For example, pizza, cereal or shoe boxes are all cuboids.

Cuboids are some of the most common polyhedra we use every day.

    figure: x-polyhedron(size=400 shape="Cube" rotate=0)

Basically, a cuboid is a polyhedron with six rectangular faces. The opposite faces of cuboids are identical and parallel to each other.  Cuboids have  [[12]] edges, [[8]] vertices.

::: column(width=200)

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch1_8.png" width="200" height="200")

::: column.grow

An average pizza box has dimensions as 33 cm x 33 cm x 4 cm. It means it has 33 cm in length, 33 cm in width, and 4 cm in height or depth.
Sometimes a cuboid has two square faces and four rectangular faces like most of the pizza boxes.

    // Page 8

An average cereal box has dimensions of 30 cm x 20 cm x 8 cm.

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch1_46.png" width="301" height="189")

::: column.grow

A Marketing agency built a 6 meters tall tipped-over cereal box outside the Vancouver Art Gallery in 2012.
Can you guess the dimensions of this cereal box?
Length: [[4 m]]   Width: [[1.6 m]]  Height: 6 m
A cereal box is a cuboid with six [[rectangular]] faces.

When you try to send boxes from one place to another via delivery services, the company asks you the dimensions of your package in the form of  “l x w x h” to calculate the size and weight of the box to determine the shipping rate.

Try identifying the dimensions of the cuboids in the form of  “l x w x h”:

### Volume

::: column.grow

According to a legend, there was a devastating plague in Greece in 430BC. The Delians (citizens of a Greek Island, Delos) went to the temple of Apollo who told them that the plague will stop when they ___double the volume of his altar.___

:::

::: column.grow

{.todo} IMAGE

Here is a line of __length 1__.

::: column.grow

{.todo} IMAGE

A square where all sides have length 1 has __area 1__.

::: column.grow

{.todo} IMAGE

A cube where all edges have length 1 has __volume 1__.

:::

We can find the volume of more complex shapes by determining how many cubes of volume 1 it contains.

The Apollo’s altar was a cubical temple with dimensions of five meters as its length, width, and height.

The Delians doubled the sides of the altar, but the plague did not stop. What went wrong?

One way to find the volume of a cuboid is to fill the cuboid with unit cubes.

Volume is the number of cubic units that fill a 3D region, without any gaps or overlaps.

Let’s look at Apollo’s altar. If the edge length of the original altar was 5 units, then its base is a 5x5 square that has [[25]] unit cubes.

There will be [[5]] layers of 25 cubes.
There must be `5 x 25 = input(125)` cubes to fill the entire altar.

__It means the original cubic altar has a volume of 125 cubic units.__

The Delians did not follow the instructions carefully. They [[doubled each side]] of the altar.
Let’s see what happened when they doubled the sides.

When we double the sides of the cıube as the Delians have done with the incorrect altar, there will be [[100]] cubes and [[10]] layers. Therefore, the second altar they built had a volume of [[1000]] cubic units.

Doubling the dimensions of a three-dimensional figure will increase its volume by a factor of [[8]].

The Delians did not double the altar - they made it 8 times bigger.

:::

They should have doubled the volume instead of the side lengths.

To find the volume of the cube, the number of cubes in the first layer is multiplied by the height. This first layer is called the base and usually refers to the top and bottom faces of the cube.

Recall the original altar. We counted [[25]] cubes in each layer. Alternatively, we could have calculated the [[ area | length | diagonal]] of the base.
The number of layers we added constitutes the [[height]] of the altar.

We calculated the volume of the cubic altar by multiplying [[Base Area]] and [[height]].

:::

---

Base Area => `ABase = input(5) x input(5) =25 m^2` and height is 5 meters

`Volume = A_Base x h`

`Volume = 25 x 5 = input(125) m^3`

In other words, the volume of a cube is the product of its length, [[width]], and [[height]].

`Volume = length x width x height`

::: column.grow

A cube has the same value as its length, width, and height.
The volume of a cube with a side length of “a” units is
`V = a • a • a = blank(x, "a3", "3a", "3 + a")`

Multiplying three edge lengths allows us to determine the volume of cube efficiently.

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch1_29.png" width="92" height="87")

:::

A cube with an edge length of 3 centimeters has a volume of [[27]] cubic centimeters, which we can write as 27 cm3.

A cube with an edge length of 4 inches has a volume of [[64]] cubic inches, which we can write as 64 [[in3]].

Volume is always measured in cubic units, such as cubic inches (in3), cubic feet [[ft3]], cubic centimeters (cm3), or cubic meters [[m3]].

Greek temples have a very predictable layout. At the center, there is a section called Cella that holds a statue of the God to which the temple is dedicated. The cella is surrounded by a long string of columns.  They are not always in cubic forms but mostly in cuboids.

    // Page 12

Helping to prevent any future conflicts, we can find a general method to find the volume of all cuboids?

The first layer of the cuboid has [[24]] cubes. It means the base area is 24 square units.

[[Height]] tells us the number of layers it takes to stack up to the cuboid.

The total number of cubes to be used to create this cuboid is [[24 x 5 = 120]].

:::

The volume is 120 cubic units.

We again calculated the volume by multiplying [[Base Area]] and  [[Height]].

`Volume = Base Area x height`
`V = A_Base x h`

In other words, the formula for the volume of all cuboids is the [[product]] of its three dimensions.

`Volume = length x width x height`
`V = l x w x h`

Now it’s your turn – find the volumes of the following cuboids.

If the base area of a cuboid smaller than the other, then its height has to be [[bigger | smaller | equal to]] to have the same volume.

If two cuboids have the same height, then the one with the greater base area has a [[greater|lesser]] volume.

We now know about how to find the volume of the cuboids, can we find another measure about them as well?

_As a prank, you may want to cover your friend’s car with lots of sticky notes. But how many will you need?_

:::

---

Let’s create a model of the car to estimate the number of sticky notes we will need.

We can use the unit cubes to create the model of the car:

::: column.fit

    figure
      x-voxel-painter(width=300 height=300 shape="0.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5,-0.5,-0.5,-0.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5,-1.5,-0.5,-0.5,-0.5,-0.5,-0.5,-1.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1.5,-0.5,0.5,0.5,-0.5,-0.5,1.5,-0.5,-0.5,0.5,-0.5" playingFieldSize="2" orthographic color-sides rotateOnly hideGrid)

::: column.grow

You can rotate the model to find how many square units it takes to cover all the faces of this three-dimensional (3D) model excluding the bottom.

The sum of the faces of the front and back = [[8]] squares.

Top of the model: [[8]] squares.

Total of the left and right sides: [[12]] squares.

The total area is [[28]] __square units__, excluding the bottom.

:::

---

{.todo} DISCUSS: Do we need this blank? Perhaps we should do something else with it.

This means the surface area of the actual car is approximately 28 __square__ [[meters | centimeters | inches | feet]].

---

{.todo} DISCUSS: use equation editor instead?

If each sticky note is `0.006 m^2`, then
we will need to have `input(28)/input(0.006)=4467` sticky notes to cover the car!

---

Here, we have calculated the __surface area__ of the car model to find the total number of sticky notes needed.

### Surface Area vs Volume

Surface area and [volume](gloss:volume) are different attributes of 3D figures.  The key difference between them is that the [[surface area | volume]] is a 2D measurement and the [[volume | surface area]] is a 3D measurement of a solid.

---
> id: voxel-surface
> goals: area

You may build different solids by using the same number of cubes.

    // TODO: INTERACTIVE-2.02: voxel painting

        button.icon-btn: x-icon(name="eraser")

Use 6 cubes to create a solid with the greatest possible surface area.

A cuboid with the surface area of [[26]] unit squares is the maximum surface area we can create by using the six cubes.

Now, create a solid with the smallest possible surface area.

:::

---

The minimum surface area is [[22]] unit squares.

---

    // page 3

Both of the solids you have created have a volume of [[6]] cubic units but have different surface areas. Notice the cubes that form solids with the more surface area are more [[spread out | compact]]. More of their faces are exposed.

---

In nature, having a large or small surface area with respect to the volume determines the vital characteristics of living things.

The relation between the surface area and the volume of an object is so important that it affects where an animal can live when a cell has to divide, or the size of the wings of an airbus plane.

For instance, do you know why elephants have giant ears?

    // https://depositphotos.com/11745121/stock-photo-elephant-isolated-on-white.html
    figure: x-img(width=600 height=400 src="https://static9.depositphotos.com/1007373/1174/i/950/depositphotos_11745121-stock-photo-elephant-isolated-on-white.jpg")

African elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They can be identified by their larger ears with respect to other elephant species. They grow up to 4 meters and weigh 6 tones on average.

Elephants and all animals generate heat internally in proportion to their volume. Larger animals produce more heat with respect to small ones like mice.

Most of the reactions like heat transfer occur at the surface of the objects and living things. It means if a large animal lives in a hot environment, then it needs to lose heat by [[maximizing | minimizing]] its surface area.

You may think of elephants as a 4 x 4 x 2 cuboid which has a surface area of [[64]] square units and a volume of [[32]] cubic units.  They need to increase their surface area to lose the heat produced by their large volume faster.

:::

---

    // page 4

::: column.grow

The ear of the African elephant is on average 180 cm by 110 cm.  Both ears add a total of [[8]] `"m"^2` surface area to the elephant. The ears increase the elephant’s surface area, while barely increasing the volume to make the heat loss faster.

Alternatively, if you were living in the Antarctic you would want a small surface area to volume ratio. This would reduce heat loss and conserve it in the body. That’s why polar versions of animals are usually [[bigger | smaller]] with respect to the other species in the same family.

### Nets

Artists and mathematicians like [Leonardo Da Vinci](bio:leonardo) devoted much effort to represent 3D objects on 2D paper. Da Vinci’s greatest accomplishment in this area is the illustrations for [Luca Pacioli](bio:pacioli)'s 1509 book _The Divine Proportion_. Da Vinci drew roughly 60 different illustrations of polyhedra in the book.

When the solids get complicated, drawing them on a 2D paper gets harder too. But there is another way to represent the 3D solids on a 2D plane.

    // page 8

We can use the [nets](gloss:net) of the solids which are composed of polygons that form the faces of a polyhedron.

The amazing structure of the honey bee cells has attracted the attention of humans for centuries.

Bees also need to have **maximum storage** for the honey without wasting more wax than necessary. This means that they need to use as little wax as possible to create their comb which can store as much honey as possible.

Recall the method we use to calculate the volume of the cuboids.

    // TODO?: Use math rendering

**Volume** = [[Base Area | Base Perimeter]] x [[height|width]]

Can we use the same formula for all prisms?

::: column.grow

The reason that the volume of a cuboid is calculated as _{span.comments(text="pill to the sliced cuboid")}**`base area xx height`**_ is that; the cuboids are formed by repeated layers of the same size base.

Let’s look at these prisms to see if they are all made up of the multiple layers of the same polygon that they have as a base.

Compared to the other prisms that leave no gaps or overlaps (such as triangular and square), the hexagon prism creates a comb with the maximum volume.

Remember, bees also need to use the least amount of wax possible to construct these combs. Since they can only produce 1 oz of wax by using 8 oz of honey, the wax is very precious for them too. They cannot spend more wax than necessary.

For finding the amount of wax needed to build walls of the combs, we need to find the [[surface area|volume]] of the prisms.

Using [[nets|projections]] can help us to calculate the surface areas of the prisms.

Nowadays, It is also being argued that bees build cylindrical cells that later transform into hexagonal prisms through a process that is still debated like physical forces and mechanical shaping.

### Pyramids

Pyramids are a particular type of architecture developed since ancient times and still used today for modern buildings. The first pyramids were built in Mesopotamia, but the most famous pyramids are the Egyptian and Mayan pyramids.

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_41.png" width="425" height="282")

Egyptians knew vertical walls got less stable as they got taller, that’s why they first tried stacked bricks at an incline. They realized that a pyramid gets you the most stability for the least material.

Thanks to the stability of the triangular structure The Great Pyramid of Giza remained the tallest building of the world for 4000 years until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889. The Great Pyramid is the oldest monument on the list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, built almost 4600 years ago.

Can you imagine the number of stones needed to build these giant ancient wonders?

The Great Pyramid of Giza along with the Pyramid of Menkaure and the Pyramid of Khafre

Like prisms, pyramids are polyhedra too. But unlike prisms, **pyramids** only have [[one|two|three]] polygonal **base**. All of the other faces of the pyramid meet at a single [[vertex|face|edge]] called _{span.comments(text="(gloss:apex)new entry - needs definition | Apex is the top vertex of the pyramids that lateral faces meet.")}**apex**_.

---

There are lots of different kinds of pyramids, depending on the shape of their base.

**Just like prisms, Pyramids are named for the shape of their** _{span.comments(text="Maybe create an interactive piece here in which students have the click on the base as I described in the prism section? Not as crucial here, but a good connection at least.")}**base**_.

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_57.png" width="600" height="417")

For example, if the _{span.comments(text="Interactive solid with a slider to open its net w/ color-coded parts")}base_ is a **square**, then it is called a “[[square|triangular]] **pyramid.**”

---

Regardless of the shape of its base, a pyramid always has [[triangular|square]] **lateral faces.**

---

Before starting to work on a pyramid, Egyptian builders had to calculate its volume in order to acquire the right amount of stone needed to build the pyramid.

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_68.png" width="600" height="600")

Imagine slicing a pyramid into lots of thin layers parallel to its base.

All cross sections will be exactly the same shape but different in size. When you go up, the size of the slices decreases proportionally to the base of the pyramid.  The cross sections of a pyramid parallel to its base are similar but not [[congruent|equal]].

---

Since pyramids are made up of decreasing the size of layers of the same base, we [[cannot|can]] use ‘**_area of the base times the height_**’ to calculate the **volume**.

---

This is sure a great advantage during the construction, but it requires a different method to calculate the volume of the pyramids.

{.fixme} We should add a paragraph (and interactive diagram) that shows that all cross sections parallel to the bases are similar (but not congruent).

{.fixme} When I teach this in school, we have a set of many different prisms and pyramids with the same base and same height. Students predict how many pyramids it will take to fill up the related prism. Then, students use rice or pasta or water to check their hypothesis. They fill up the pyramid and pour it into the prism and count how many it takes to fill it up. I found this a really powerful and effective lesson. I wonder how some of that could be incorporated here? I image the GIF on the first slide has some animation of that, but I wonder if there is a way to make students do it? There could be an empty square based pyramid and an empty cuboid and the fill up the pyramid with water by placing it under a sink and then they have to drag it over to the cuboid and fill up the cube. Then, they'd actually have to do it 3 times. Not quite as powerful as doing it in person I think, but if they do it 2-3 times, they helps build understanding of the formula. | I totally agree - I was doing the same experiment with my students with the set of geo solids.. I was planning to talk with Philipp about the animations, pills, hover targets in this section.

It is plenty of room for the Pharaoh and his belongings. It is estimated 2.3 million stone blocks each weigh an average of 2.5 to 15 tons were used to build a pyramid that size.

Recall that all pyramids also have a slant height, which is the height of its [[ lateral faces|base]]. It is usually denoted either `s` or `l`.

The slant height is used to calculate the [[areas|perimeters]] of the lateral faces.

Slant Height of the Great Pyramid is 186.6m. Each triangle face’s area is [[½ (base xx height) | base area xx height]] which is 21,500 `"m"^2`.

Since we have [[4]] lateral faces, the total **lateral area** is _{span.comments(text="Instead of the direct result, this can be an equation filed too")}[[86000]]_.

Each block of limestone covered about 1.25 square meters. So the Egyptians need almost 70 000 extra white limestones to cover the lateral faces of the pyramid.

While it still stays as a mystery how Egyptians build the pyramids, _{span.comments(text="gph.is/1yqexne")} it is no longer a mystery for us how many stones are used to build or cover them_.

Surface Area calculations in prisms and pyramids have longer steps than finding their volume.

In surface area calculations, **nets** allow us to see all the faces of the solid at once. While calculating surface area, base or lateral area, instead of working on a picture of the solid, drawing nets helps us to visualize the hidden faces.

On market stalls or street vendor carts, fruits like apples, and oranges are mostly arranged as [[pyramids|prisms]].

In 1611 Johannes Kepler stated that putting each fruit on top of a gap in the layer of fruit underneath is the most efficient arrangement of spherical objects.

After almost 400 years, in 1998, Thomas Hales presented a proof of the Kepler Conjecture. The proof was 300 pages long and it took a computer to verify its correctness.

Apparently, when it comes to stacking stones and fruits or piling cannonballs on ships, pyramids are always the most convenient shape!

We may not build a pyramid or the tallest building of the world yet, but we can start planning for a treehouse (Playhouse / tent…).

Like Egyptians do, before we start building one, we need to calculate the amount of material we are going to use for the outer surface of our model.

A house-shaped prism is created by attaching a [[triangular prism triangular pyramid | square pyramid]] on top of a [[rectangular prism|pentagonal prism]].

---

These types of solids are called **Composite solids**.

    // TODO: Decide what to do with this (can blanks be pills?)

The base of the house-shaped prism consists of a [[[rectangle]]](pill:teal) and a [[[triangle]]](pill:orange).

We may find the area of the rectangle and triangle separately and then add them up to find the [[base area|base perimeter]].

[Rectangle’s area](pill:teal)is _{span.comments(text="Equation field")}`3 xx 2 = 6 "m"^2`_ and the [triangle’s area](pill:orange) is _{span.comments(text="Equation Field")}`(1/2) (3 xx 2) = 3 "m"2`_

So each base area is [[9]] `"m"^2`

:::

---

Now we can find the **lateral area** of the model;

Is there a way to simplify the calculations?

Imagine unfolding the prism into a net. Use the slider to see the **net** of the house-shaped prism.

    // COMMENT: Scene 1

We can use one large rectangle instead of separate smaller ones.

We can treat the prism-like house as having three parts: two identical bases, and one long rectangle that has been taped along the edges of the bases.

The rectangle has the [[same|different]] height as the prism, and its width is the [[perimeter of the base|width of the base]].

---

    // COMMENT: Scene 2

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch3_8.png" width="600" height="569")

**In fact, for all the prisms,  you can combine each rectangular lateral face and find the entire area by multiplying the height of the prism by the perimeter of the base.**

So the area of the big rectangle that covers all the lateral face of the prism is [[12]] xx 4 = [[48]] `"m"^2`.

---

    // COMMENT: Scene 3

Now, all we are going to do is to add two [[base areas|base perimeters]] to the [[lateral area|lateral perimeter]].

---

So the surface area is [[66]] `"m"^2`.

---

What about the volume?

The Base Area was 9 `"m"^2` and the height is [[4]] `"m"`.

---

Therefore, after completing the construction, your treehouse will have a volume of [[36]] `"m"^3`

You may have different designs for your treehouse but, as long as they are prism-like shapes, their volume will always be calculated as `"Base Area" xx "Height"`.

## Cylinders and Cones

> section: cylinder-cone
> sectionStatus: dev

**Ever wondered why all rockets have similar shapes?**

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_19.png" width="300" height="281")

::: column.grow

In the past 60 years, rocket technology has advanced significantly, and more than 35 000 rockets have been sent to space.

While launching a rocket to the space, there are three main forces you need to be aware of:

_{span.comments(text="Gravity is the force that attracts a body toward the center of the earth or any other planet.")}*Gravity*_, _{span.comments(text="Ar resistance İis the force that is in the opposite direction to the motion of an object as it passes through the air. Also, known as 'drag'.")}*air resistance*_ and _{span.comments(text="The propulsive force of a jet or rocket engine. Thrust generated by the rockets’ engines by using the fuel to push the rocket upward.")}*thrust*_

:::

The shape of the rockets designed to minimize the air resistance called drag. Smooth, **round surfaces** produce less friction so cause [[less|more]] drag.

---

Therefore, it is clear that we need [[non-polyhedra|polyhedra]] in the rocket design.

---

**Rockets are** _{span.comments(text="Pills: cone disappears at the rocket model - and the cylinder is shown only.")}**cylindrical**_ **in body and** _{span.comments(text="Pills: cylinder disappears at the rocket model - and the cone is shown only.")}**conical**_ **at the top.**

We can think of **cylinders** as circular versions of prisms. Similarly, we say that the circular version of a pyramid is a **cone**.

::: column(width=300)

    // Prism-> Cylinder Animation

Use the _{span.comments(text="Variable slider")}slider_ to increase the number of sides of the pyramid.

As the number of sides increases, the prism starts to look more like a cylinder.

::: column(width=300)

    // Pyramid-> Cone Animation

Use the slider to increase the number of sides of the prism.

As the number of sides increases, the pyramid starts to look more like a cone.

    // An interactive Cylinder

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_33.png" width="150" height="150")

::: column.grow

Cylinders consist of two congruent, parallel circles joined by a curved surface. These circles are the _{span.comments(text="pills")}bases_** of the cylinder.

The cylindrical part of the rockets accommodates the rocket's essential components like liquid oxygen, hydrogen tanks and engines.

:::

---

In fact all the pressure vessels like fuel tankers are round, since round shapes provide maximum strength from internal pressure. A cylindrical shape adds less weight of the rocket’s walls. Cylinders also don’t have any “weak points” like the edges of the [[prisms|polygons]].

---

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_1.png" width="170" height="156")

::: column.grow

The only problem with cylindrical structures is the drag rate. This value can be reduced slightly by adding a cone to the top.

The conical shape can be in different forms according to the purpose of the rocket.

:::

    // An interactive Cone

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_24.png" width="150" height="150")

::: column.grow

A cone has [[only one|two]] circular **base** that is joined to a single point called the **vertex** or **apex**.

Nose cones of the rockets usually carry payloads like satellite, cargo or passengers. If it is the external fuel tank, it carries the liquid oxygen tank.

:::

---

Nose cones are also designed for all the aircrafts like planes and zeppelins as well as the underwater and in high-speed land vehicles.

While the shape of the rockets are mostly similar, they can be in different sizes according to the type of the mission.

**What is the height of a rocket with an orbital mission carrying 23 tons payload?**

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_8.png" width="188" height="142")
    // https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=su9EVeHqizY&feature=emb_logo
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_external_tank#/media/File:STS-116_PreLaunch_(NASA_KSC-06PD-2670).jpg

::: column.grow

Type of the mission affects the amount of fuel that the rocket has to carry. The significant portion of the rockets’ volume is held by fuel tanks, therefore the size of the rocket mostly depends on the fuel tanks.

For an orbital mission, fuel tanks must have the capacity to hold approximately 550 thousands liters of liquid oxygen and 1.5 million liters of hydrogen.

:::

In a space shuttle, the external fuel tank carries a cylindrical liquid hydrogen tank.

The **volume** of the cylinder is a measurement describing how much (in cubic units) the cylinder will hold. It is a measure of the space inside the cylinder.

Think of a stack of coins as a model of a cylinder. The number of coins you put on top of each other is actually the _{span.comments(text="The height of the cylinder is the the perpendicular distance between the bases.")}[[height|radius|diameter|circumference]]_ of the cylinder.

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_15.png" width="239" height="118")

::: column.grow

So the space you have created with the coin stack is basically [[height|width]] times the [[area|perimeter]] of each coin.

Like the prisms, a cylinder has a volume equal to the **product of its** [[base area|base circumference]] **and** [[height|width]].

:::

---

Recall that the ratio of the area of a circle to its square radius is a constant number called _{x-equation.small(solution="π" keys="π")}_. So the area of a circle is _{x-equation.small(solution="π r^2" keys="π sup" short-var)}_.

---

Pi is an [[irrational|rational]] number.

---

This indicates that the decimal part of the π goes to infinity without repeating itself.

π = 3.1415926…

The volume of a cylinder is,

{.text-center} `"V"_"Cylinder" = "Base Area" xx "Height"`

{.text-center} `"V"_"Cylinder" = ` _{x-equation.small(solution="π r^2 × h" keys="π sup ×" short-var)}_

::: column.grow

The cylindrical hydrogen tank has a diameter of approximately 8 meters. It needs to hold 1.5 million liters of hydrogen.

Remember `1 "\ dm"^3 = 1 "\ liters"`

So the volume of the hydrogen tank has to be around [[1500]] `m^3`.

:::

---

`1500 = input(pi) * input(4)^2 * "Height"_"Liquid Hydrogen Tank"` which is around 30 meters.

---

The liquid oxygen tank is on the other hand, located at the top of the external tank and has a **conical shape**.

Remember that cones are the [[pyramid|prism]] - like solids with the circular bases

---

Even though a cone is technically not a pyramid, they share many properties.

To calculate the volume of a cone, can we still use the same formula with the pyramids?

The ratio of the volumes of a pyramid and a prism with the base of same size and shape and the same _{span.comments(text="The height of the cone is theperpendicular distance between thecenter of the base and the apex.")}height_ is [[1]] : [[3]].

---

::: column.fit

::: column.grow

Let’s repeat the same experiment to see how many cones of water are needed to fill the cylinder with the same radius and height.

It takes the contents of [[3]] cones to fill the cylinder with the same base and height. This means,

---

{.text-center} `"V"_"Cone" =` _{x-equation.small(solution="(1 / 3) × π r^2 × h" keys="frac sup π ×" short-var)}_

---

Nose cone has the same radius with the cylinder and has to hold 550 thousand liters of oxygen. Therefore the conical tank has to have a volume of 550 cubic meters.

{.text-center} `550 =` _{x-equation.small(solution="1 / 3" keys="frac" numeric)}_ `*` _{x-equation.small(solution="π" keys="π")}_ `* input(4)^2 * blank("Height"_"OxygenTank","Radius"_"OxygenTank")`

---

{.text-center} which is around 30 meters.

The real shape of the cone is larger than the one that we have calculated here and has a height of almost 17 meters. So the total height of the External Tank is around 50 meters.

When full with the fuel, External tank alone weighs 760 thousands kilograms. Rocket companies try to increase the efficiency of the rockets by decreasing the overall weight and increasing the payload capacity.

In time, many attempts were made to reduce the huge amount of weight of the tanks.  Standard weight tanks are evolved to super lightweight tanks by examining every little detail of the rockets carefully.

Inıtially, fuel tanks were painted white to protect them from ultraviolet light damage. Engineers then realized that did not cause a problem and wondered **if no paint is used, how many kilograms of weight can be spared?**

To be able to find the amount of paint used, we calculate the [[surface area | volume | perimeter]] of the tank.

---

Again, we can think of the cylinder and the cone separately.

**Surface area of a cylinder:**

 We can use the [[net|height|width]] of the cylinder to calculate its surface area.

---

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_2.png" width="100" height="104")

    // An interactive Cylinder

::: column.grow

The net of the cylinder has two [[circles|rectangles]] with the area of _{x-equation.small(solution="π r^2" keys="π sup" short-var)}_ each. The curved face is actually a large [[rectangle|square|triangle|pentagon]].

The height of the rectangle is [[h|w|b]] and the width of the rectangle is the same as the [[circumference of the base|base area|diameter of the base]] of the circles.

:::

---

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_34.svg" width="300" height="208")

::: column.grow

Since the lateral face of the cylinder is a rectangle, we can find the area by [[multiplying|dividing|adding|subtracting]] the length and width of the rectangle;

It is basically the [[circumference|radius|diameter]] of the base times the [[height|width]] of the cylinder.

Therefore, the lateral area is _{x-equation.small(solution="2 π r" keys="π" short-var)}_ `* blank("h","w")`.

:::

---

So the **Surface Area** of a cylinder is the sum of all the face areas.

{.text-center} `"A"_"Cylinder" = ` _{x-equation.small(solution="2 π r^2" keys="π sup" short-var)}_ `+` _{x-equation.small(solution="2 π r × h" keys="π ×" short-var)}_

---

The surface area of the cylindrical part of the tank with a height of 30 meters and a diameter of  8 meters . For the rocket model we need to calculate [[only one|two]] base areas for the total surface area.

---

`"A" = (pi "r"^2) + (2 pi "r""h")`

`A = pi input(4)^2 + 2 pi input(4) * input(30)` approximately

---

`A = 800 blank("square meters","meters","cubic meters")`.

---

**Surface area of a cone:**

::: column.grow

Move the slider to see the net of the cone. We have a [[circle|sphere|square]] as the base and a [[circle sector|triangle|rectangle]] lateral area.

“s” is called the _{span.comments(text="Glossary Link")}**slant height**_ of the cone, the same as the pyramids. Slant height is [[different than|as the same as]] the solid height.

Now we just have to add up the area of both faces;

The base of the cone  is a circle with radius r, so its area is

`"A"_"base" =` _{x-equation.small(solution="π r^2" keys="π sup" short-var)}_

::: column.fit

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_16.png" width="300" height="92")

::: column.grow

We may think the lateral  area as one large triangle consists of infinitely many triangles.The total length of the triangle’s base is the [[circumference|area|diameter]] of the circle and its height is s, slant height of the cone.

:::

---

Recall that the area of a triangle is one [[half|third|quarter]] of the product of its base length and height.

---

`"A"_"lateral" = 1/2 ` _{x-equation.small(solution="2 π r" keys="π" short-var)}_ `* blank("s","h","l")`

---

`"A"_"lateral" =` _{x-equation.small(solution="π r s" keys="π" short-var)}_

---

Then, the total area of the cone is

{.text-center} `"A"_"cone" =` _{x-equation.small(solution="π r^2 + π r s" keys="π sup +" short-var)}_

---

To find the amount of the paint used, we need to calculate the [[lateral area|base area|surface area]] of the cone.

---

The Conical part of the tank has a slant height of 20 meters and a diameter of 8 meters.

`"A"_"Lateral" = pi * input(4) * input(20)` approximately

---

`"A"_"Lateral" = 250 blank("square meters", "meters", "cubic meters")`.

---

The total surface area of the rocket is the sum of the area of the cylindrical body [[800]] square meters and the nose cone [[250]] square meters  which is [[1050]] square meters.

---

If a gallon of paint is used to cover a **12 square meters,** to cover the entire tank, almost [[90]] gallons of paint must be used.

---

Approximate weight of a gallon of exterior paint is almost 3 kilograms. Therefore, by not painting the tank, the engineers spared [[270]] kilograms that they can use to increase the cargo capacity or the efficiency of the space shuttle.

---

So far, we have learnt the surface area and the volume calculations of the cylinders and the cones as well as the unique properties of these solids that make them right choices for the rocket design as well as the other drag reducing land and underwater vehicles..

If we consider our initial question again, we may have a look at another property of the cylinder.

Let’s compare the volumes of different prisms with the same base perimeter and height;

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch4_28.png" width="600" height="532")

    // 3D Version of this applet?

It also turns out that [[cylindrical|spherical|conical]] shapes hold the largest amount of volume compared to different prisms with the same base perimeter and height. This is another reason cylinders have the best properties as a container like the food and beverage cans we use everyday and the huge tanks like grain silos.

Mountains and volcanoes maintain the interesting conical shape of these rock formations but they are much bigger.

The Highest Mountain of our world, Everest,  is growing taller up to 5 centimeters each year. **Can it grow infinitely and become as high as the** _{span.comments(text="Olympus Mons is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars.

Is there a limit for the maximum possible height of a mountain on Earth?**

There is an interesting fact about the height of the mountains.

By approximating the shape of the mountains to [[cones|spheres|cylinders]], we can approximately find out the maximum height of a mountain.

    // An interactive applet where students can drag up the height of the mountain by 500meters - calculates the weight of the mountain - when hits the max limit,  the mountain sinks.

    // 1. **Weight to Base Area ratio** of a mountain cannot exceed the compressive strength of the rock beneath the mountain. Otherwise the rock beneath the mountain starts to compress. The mountain simply would crumble under their own weight.

    // After 4)

When we solve the inequality here, we will see that a mountain on Earth can be maximum around [[10]] km tall before collapsing under its own weight!

---

This is just a little bit higher than Mt Everest!

If 8800 meters-tall-Everest continues to grow around 5 cm a year, almost [[24000]] years later, we may expect it to sink!?

---

But do not worry! We still have another mountain which is in fact much higher than Mt Everest.

Just it is on Mars.

The highest volcano in the solar system is Olympus Mons on Mars with a height of over 21 km and a radius of 312 km.

    // With 5)

You can change the constants from Earth to Mars to calculate the maximum height of a mountain on Mars.

With a rough approximation since the gravity of Mars is almost `1/3` of the gravity on Earth. We can conclude that a mountain on Mars can be [[3]] times taller than a mountain on earth.

Let’s _{span.comments(text="Interactive drawing tool")}try to draw the [net](gloss:net) of a sphere._

If it is not possible to draw the nets of the spheres how do we have the 2D maps of our world?

    // A gif / video or slideshow?

If a _{span.comments(text="A globe is a spherical model of Earth.

The size, shape, and relative location of continents would change.  Since drawing an accurate net of a sphere is impossible, we reflect the spherical surface of Earth to a flat piece of paper by using different **projections.**

Unfortunately, there is no truly correct way of representing the earth as a flat image. All the 2D maps are distorted in some manner!

None of these flat figures can fold up to a sphere.

He studied circles, cylinders, and spheres until he died and made approximations for the number pi and he discovered the volume and the area of the sphere by using the shapes he already knew about like cylinders and cones.

To find this ratio, let’s use the water experiment we have used before when comparing the pyramids and prisms.

We need to have a cylinder and cone with the same heights as the diameter of their bases **(h = 2r)** and a sphere with exactly the same diameter.

We have just demonstrated that the volume of the sphere is the `input(2) / input(3)` of the cylinder with the same dimensions.

`"V"_"SPHERE" = 2 / 3` _{x-equation.small(solution="π r^2 h" keys="π sup" short-var)}_ since `"h" = 2"r"`, we can replace `"h"`

`"V"_"SPHERE" = (2/3) pi r^2 *` _{x-equation.small(solution="2 r" short-var)}_

`"V"_"SPHERE" =` _{x-equation.small(solution="π r^3" keys="π sup" short-var)}_

Archimedes has also found that the **same ratio** exists between the **surface areas** of the cylinder and sphere as well.

Surface Area of a Cylinder = _{x-equation.small(solution="(2 π r^2) + (2 π r h)" keys="π sup +" short-var)}_

If we use the same ratio of `input(2) / input(3)` to find the surface area of the sphere;

The radius of Earth at the equator is 6378 kilometers. Although it is not a perfect sphere, we can still use the sphere’s volume formula to make a fair approximation.

The **surface area** of the Earth can also be found by using the Archimedes formula _{x-equation.small(solution="4 π r^2" keys="π sup" short-var)}_.

`"A"_"Earth" = 4 pi r^2 = 4 * pi * input(6378)^2 =` **510 million square kilometers.**

About 70 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered by water. It means **the surface area of water is approximately `510 "million" xx %input(70) = input(357) "million square kilometers"`.**

::: column.fit

    figure: x-img(src="images/ch5_41.svg" width="200" height="106")

The average depth of oceans is about 4 km, so we can calculate the volume of the water on Earth as `input(357) "miilion" xx input(4)`: almost 1.4 billion `"km"^3` (14 x 1020 liters).

This means that while the water covers 70% of the Earth’s surface, it has a volume of much less than 1% of Earth’s entire volume.
